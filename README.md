Clone this directory into and run:

pip install -r requrements.txt

and then:

python get_sb_data.py

It will download all of the open 360 (to a folder called 'sb_data') and create a sqllite database (called 'sb_data.sql')

The SQL schema can be sort of inferred by looking at soccer_db_schema.py and it is not complete! This is just a first pass!
